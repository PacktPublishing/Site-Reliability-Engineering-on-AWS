# Site Reliability Engineering on AWS [Video]
This is the code repository for [Site Reliability Engineering on AWS](https://www.packtpub.com/cloud-networking/site-reliability-engineering-on-aws-video). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Reliability in AWS includes the ability of a system to recover from infrastructure or service disruptions. It's essential to acquire computing resources to meet the demand, and mitigate disruptions such as configuration issues or transient network problems.

In this course, you will first explore the key concepts and core services of AWS and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE). We show you step-by-step how to implement a real-world application that is built via the reliability principles defined within the AWS Well-Architected Framework using the SRE approach. So you can increase the reliability of application architectures on AWS by implementing resilience infrastructure and application resilience.

You will be covering some common architectural patterns used every day by real-world AWS solution architects to build reliable systems and implement fault tolerance into an application architecture running on AWS. While learning how to further increase the reliability of application architectures on AWS by implementing multi-region solutions for disaster recovery on a global scale.

By the end of this course, you will have gained a variety of AWS architecture skills that you can then apply to the real world.
